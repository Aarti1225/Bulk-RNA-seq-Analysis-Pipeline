# Bulk-RNA-seq-Analysis-Pipeline
This repository contains a step-by-step pipeline for analyzing bulk RNA-seq data from the study by Guo et al., Nature Communications (2019) â€” GSE106305.
We focus on LNCaP and PC3 prostate cancer cell lines, comparing normoxia vs hypoxia conditions to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs).
